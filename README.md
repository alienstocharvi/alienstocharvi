# ðŸ‘¾ Hey there, I'm Charvi.

> "Machines learn, I teach them."

I am a Computer Science Engineering student exploring the fields of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and everything that blurs the line between logic and intuition. Right now, I am building my foundation in **Python, Data Structures, and AI systems**, while experimenting with projects that connect **data, design, and decision-making**.

### What I'm Into:
- Machine Learning & AI-based automation
- Data Science & backend logic
- Building smart tools that actually make life easier
- Understanding how humans and algorithms think

---

### Tech Stack:
`Python` â€¢ `NumPy` â€¢ `Pandas` â€¢ `Scikit-learn` â€¢ `HTML` â€¢ `CSS` â€¢ `JavaScript`
*(learning Flask, TensorFlow, and backend architecture soon)*

### Current Focus:

- Strengthening core CS concepts
- Building ML mini-projects
- Open-sourcing small but meaningful tools
- Writing cleaner, smarter code everyday
