# 👾 Hey there, I'm Charvi.

> Machines learn, I teach them.

I am a Computer Science Engineering student working toward AI and ML systems development. 
My current focus is strengthening Python and data structures while building small, decision-oriented ML projects that emphasize clarity, correctness, and reproducibility.
I am particularly interested in why models fail and how design and logic choices affect real outcomes.

## Current Tech Stack:

### Actively Using:
`Python` • `NumPy` • `Pandas` • `Scikit-learn` 
• `HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript (Basic Front-End)` 
### Learning Next:
Flask • TensorFlow •Backend System Design

---

## Current Focus:

- Strengthening core CS fundamentals with emphasis on data structures and problem-solving
- Building and refining small ML systems
- Open-sourcing narrowly scoped, well-documented tools

## Looking for Help With:
- Choosing model complexity, features, and validation strategies for small ML projects without overfitting
- Planning backend structure for ML tools before implementation (data flow, model integration, and future extensibility)

## Featured Repositories:
- **Brew-Your-Mood**
A rule-based decision tool that converts user's mood inputs into coffee recommendations. Built to practice conditional logic, input handling, and translating subjective choices into structured decisions.
Focus areas: decision logic, clean control flow, and user-facing simplicity.
- **ml-under-the-hood**
A learning-first repository that breaks down machine learning fundamentals by focusing on intuition, mathematics, and minimal implementations. Built to understand how models actually work rather than relying on black-box libraries.
Focus areas: first-principles reasoning, from-scratch implementations, and conceptual clarity.
